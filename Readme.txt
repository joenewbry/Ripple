Ripple - A local social network

A few things todo:
Make nearby people hide on scroll up and show up on scroll down
Make your image icon show up correctly
Done: Make Chat bubbles appear on proper side
Make Chat relation work properly with Parse Cloud code
Make Parse Cloud code send push notifications
Make profile information work properly

* Built to showcase a bluetooth social framework I built for my thesis
* Also to test to see if people want to be able to communicate
  solely on the basis of proximity
* And because it is fun!
